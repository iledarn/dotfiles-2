Dotfiles
========

This repository includes all of my custom dotfiles.  They should be cloned to
your home directory so that the path is `~/.dotfiles/`.  The included setup
script creates symlinks from your home directory to the files which are located
in `~/.dotfiles/`.

Installation
------------

``` bash
git clone git://github.com/olanmatt/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
make osx
```
